# Refactoring the webpage for Horiseon

The code featured in this repository was made to change the structure and improve the pre-existing contents of the html and css files. The previous code was in need of proper comments and  spacing so that it could be read more efficiently. Named sections were created to replace the many divs, links were fixed to bring the user to the correct place on the page, and alt attributes were included to better the accessibility. The css style sheet also underwent changes, code was consolidated and organized so that any future changes could be made more easily.
